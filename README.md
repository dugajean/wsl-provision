# WSL Provision

This is a set of personal scripts used to provision WSL Ubuntu 18.04 to my personal needs. You may adjust it to suit you. This one sets up a basic LAMP stack with multiple PHP versions.

## To do:

- Install xDebug for all PHP versions
- Properly configure MySQL
- Create another MySQL user
- Disable MySQL root login
- Switch oh-my-zsh theme to `ys`
